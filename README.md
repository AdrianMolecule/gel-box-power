Project is incompletely documented despite having the physical. Aside from that the project is functional, stabile and has been tested. No immediate plans to change and no outstanding bugs for the implementation yet the laser cut models need to be readjusted to the implementation.
I will create 2 more associated projects: one for the gelbox and combs and one for the transiluminator
This project contains the design of a gel box power supply and contains information about the electronics and model for the case. There are 2 options for the casing: a CNC cut case and a lasercut one.

TODO
Lasercut models need change to match the built case:
  1 for the LED housing to match the 3D printed casing. Print it finger jointed as cap.
  2 raise the top deeper side by about 3 mm so it does not bump into the LED case.
  3 Lasercut the wire conduits and engrave electrical tape track
  4 Add holes to attach PCBs and LED boxes

Shall I keep the 3D printed led boxes? Maybe if somebody wants to create an iluminator independent of the gelbox. Need to think about that. In any case I shall add the old 3D printed boxes for reference.
