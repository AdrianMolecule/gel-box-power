Project is incompletely documented. Aside from that the project is functional, stabile and has been tested. No immediate plans to change and no outstanding bug.
I will create 2 more associated projects: one for the gelbox and combs and one for the transiluminator
This project contains the design of a gel box power supply and contains information about the electronics and model for the case. There are 2 options for the casing: a CNC cut case and a lasercut one.
