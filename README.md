This is a project containing the design of a transilluminator and power box for an electrophoresis gel box but not the gel box or other parts.
In the future I'll move the transilluminator and I'll archive or delete this repository.
For the gelbox or the power go to https://github.com/AdrianMolecule/gelelectrophoresis as it contains the actual gel box and the box for the power but not the transilluminator.

Project is incompletely documented. Aside from that the implementation of this design is functional, stabile and has been tested. No immediate plans to change and no outstanding bugs for the implementation yet the laser cut models need to be reajusted to the implementation.

I will probably create 2 more associated projects: one for the gelbox (done) and combs and one for the transiluminator
This project contains the design of the electronics and model for the case. There are 2 options for the casing: a CNC cut case and a lasercut one and, at this pont no plans for a 3D printed case as it would take too long to print.
I will aslo need to add the gerber file for the transilluminator part as it needs a custom PCB. There is not custom PCB for the power box.
TODO move the transilluminator to the gelElectrophoresis repository and obsolete this project.
Lasercut models need change to match the built case:
  1 for the LED housing to match the 3D printed casing. Print it finger jointed as cap.
  2 raise the top deeper side by about 3 mm so it does not bump into the LED case.
  3 Lasercut the wire conduits and engrave electrical tape track
  4 Add holes to attach PCBs and LED boxes

Shall I keep the 3D printed led boxes? Maybe if somebody wants to create an iluminator independent of the gelbox. Need to think about that. In any case I shall add the old 3D printed boxes for reference.
